# alpha60-twitter-bot
A Twitter bot named Alpha 60 which tweets back to #Python3. 
Mention @alpha6011 and #Python3 to see desired results.
Though currently the script is not running so you will not get anything.

##How To Use?
1. Create Developer Account in Twitter: https://developer.twitter.com/en
2. Create an App with Read and write permissions  
3. Generate keys and Add them separately in a file name keys.py
4. Now Run my_twitter_bot.py to see the results!

I have added comments wherever I thought it's necessary, so go through them for added help.

I didn't know how to create Twitter API with read and write permission. Any help is warmly welcomed.
But, Code is complete and working for both read and write
